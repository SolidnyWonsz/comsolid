# comsolid

## What is this?

Comsolid (basically Solid Communication) is software - or collection of two programs (comsolid-client & comsolid-server) - that allows clients to communicate with other clients via `Voice over IP` technology. The software is supposed to be lightweight and allow for low latency voice communication using the UDP protocol. You can also host your own Comsolid server. 

## Why?

I wanted to have as lowest latency as I could, so I can jam with my band. It's hard to play music with someone when all the instruments are delayed :)

It's not supposed to be a big, new communicator that's going to beat Discord or anything else. I chose to make my own software instead of using available solutions just for the sake of making such software and deepening my knowledge of sockets, network protocols etc.
